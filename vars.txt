Two inputs to convolution:

D is a four-dimensional N x C x H x W tensor which forms the input data. Tensor is a mathematical term
for arrays that have more than two dimensions. In mathematics, matrices have only two dimensions. Arrays
with three or more dimensions are called tensors. For the purpose of this book, one can simply treat
a T-dimensional tensor as a T-dimensional array.

F is a four-dimensional K x C x R x S tensor, which forms the convolutional filters

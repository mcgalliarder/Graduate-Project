# Graduate-Project
CNN Code for GPU Parallel Programming Graduate Project

A local copy of this project is found on the cuda server at /home/students/barrsj/5530/Graduate-Project

## How to use
1. Simply compile by invoking the make command
2. To run, type "convNet \<image>.pgm" using one of the pgm images in the file

The program prints out the pgm, then the output of the convolution with randomly generated weights.  It then prints out the output of the pooling layer
